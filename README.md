# ShonaSenti

In this repository we provide the first Shona sentiment analysis corpus and corresponding python scripts to process it. 

* Corpus of Shona tweets for training and testing sentiment analysis systems, labelled with 3 sentiment classes (negative, neutral, positive) and 5 sentiment classes (very       negative, negative, neutral, positive and very positive).

* Scripts for fetching tweets, processing, language detection, and pre-labelling with emojis.
